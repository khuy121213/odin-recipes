# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations Curriculum. The goal was to build a basic recipe website using only HTML to demonstrate an understanding of headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

## Live Demo
[View the live project here](https://khuy121213.github.io/odin-recipes/index.html)

## Features
* A main index page with links to various recipes.
* Individual recipe pages containing:
    * An image of the finished dish.
    * A description section.
    * An unordered list of ingredients.
    * An ordered list of preparation steps.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I practiced:
* Structuring a web page with proper HTML tags.
* Working with relative and absolute file paths.
* Organizing project directories.

## Credits
All recipes and images were sourced from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
